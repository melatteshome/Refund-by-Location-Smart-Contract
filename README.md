# Refund-by-Location-Smart-Contract

Bussiness Neeed

GeoLogix  Solutions utilises a location-based smart contract to facilitate automatic payments for drivers who remain within specified geographic zones for set durations. This system involves drivers' smartphones transmitting GPS data to an Ethereum smart contract at predetermined intervals. When a driver meets the conditions outlined in the contract, a cryptocurrency transaction is processed as payment.


The project's goal is to develop and deploy an Ethereum-based decentralised application (dApp) that includes a thoroughly tested smart contract on a testnet, accompanied by a user interface for real-time status monitoring and management by GeoLogix Solutions.

This project contians three folders 
        1,admin - this folder containes a react code admin dashboard that will allow our admin to look at the drivers list , specifiy the parameters for the smart contract
        2,contract - this folder containes the smart contract that will be responsible for paying our drivers if they meet the location criteria 
        3,driver - this folder contians the code for the driver mobile application that will be resonsible fir sending the driver's location within specified amount of time.
