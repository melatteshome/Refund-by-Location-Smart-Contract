# Refund-by-Location-Smart-Contract

Bussiness Neeed

GeoLogix  Solutions utilises a location-based smart contract to facilitate automatic payments for drivers who remain within specified geographic zones for set durations. This system involves drivers' smartphones transmitting GPS data to an Ethereum smart contract at predetermined intervals. When a driver meets the conditions outlined in the contract, a cryptocurrency transaction is processed as payment.


The project's goal is to develop and deploy an Ethereum-based decentralised application (dApp) that includes a thoroughly tested smart contract on a testnet, accompanied by a user interface for real-time status monitoring and management by GeoLogix Solutions.
